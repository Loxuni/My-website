        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Magnus, 
            and I'm passionate about technology, coding, and the ever-evolving 
            world of digital innovation.</p>
     
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I started my journey in the tech world from a young age, always 
            curious about how things work. This insatiable curiosity eventually 
            led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Data Engineering. Over the years, 
            I've gained experience in various programming languages and technologies, 
            from Java and Python to web development and database management.</p>
    
        <h3>Why this website?</h3>    
        <p>I created this platform as a way to share knowledge, insights, and exciting 
            developments in the tech industry. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just 
            someone interested in learning more about technology, there's something here for you.</p>
        
        <h3>My mission</h3>
        <p>My mission is to simplify complex tech topics in a way that is easy to understand and useful, 
            whether you're looking to solve a particular problem or just want to broaden your understanding 
            of a subject.</p>
        
        <h3>What can you expect?</h3>    
        <p>Here, you'll find articles ranging from deep technical tutorials to general 
            advice on best study practices in tech. I also showcase various projects 
            I've worked on to give you a real-world application of some of the things we discuss.</p>
